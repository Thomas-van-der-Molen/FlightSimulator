# FlightSimulator
The final game project for Comp Sci Java. 
All GUI is built with the swing api and rendering is done with my 3d rendering package. 
Terrain is generated using a simplex noise algorithm (which I didnt make). 

Project is meant to be educational which is why there is a lot of unnecessary code outside of just the flight simulation part.
